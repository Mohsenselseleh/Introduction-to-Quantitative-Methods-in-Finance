• Use probabilistic to study stock movement volatility using historical data. • Use volatility predictions to evaluate a portfolio’s value at risk and to price European option contracts using Monte-Carlo and binomial tree methodology. • Create accurate European option price predictions by enhancing Monte-Carlo simulations through the use of control variates. Accuracy will be measured against closedform solutions to option contracts provided by Black-Scholes option pricing equations. • Adjust Monte-Carlo simulations of European contracts for the purpose of pricing more complicated option contracts whose expected value does not have a closed form solutions. Such option contracts may include American, Asian, lookback, and barrier option contracts. • Develop hedging strategies which minimize risk and improve expected profit distributions of an option investment strategy. • Backtest a trading strategy using historical stock prices.
